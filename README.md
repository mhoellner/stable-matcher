# stable-matcher

Finds stable matching for two parties with a set of preferences. This code is for illustrative and learning purposes.

## History

The Stable Matching algorithm used in this project is the Gale-Shapley algorithm which is very simple but very powerful algorithm
to find stable matches for two parties each with a set of preferences. It was first introduced by D. Gale and L.S. Shapley in the
article "College Admissions and the Stability of Marriage" published in 1962 in "The American Mathematical Monthly" (see http://www.jstor.org/stable/2312726).
This algorithm and the theory behind it are so helpful and interesting that led Lloyd S. Shapley together with Alvin E. Roth
to win the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2012 "for the theory of stable allocations and the practice of market design"
(see http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2012/).

## Usage

1. Open a command prompt
2. Navigate to the source code -> bin/Debug (you'll need to compile first)
3. Execute StableMatcher.exe
4. Enjoy!

## Compile in Visual Studio (2017)

1. Start Visual Studio.
2. Go to the menu option "File -> Open -> Project/Solution -> StableMatcher.sln".
3. Build the StableMatcher Project

## Execute Unit Tests

1. In Visual Studio, open the solution
2. Open the Test Explorer by going to Test -> Analyze Code Coverage -> All Tests
3. All Tests should pass before pushing your commits
4. The Code Coverage Results are a tab at the bottom of Visual Studio



Please just commit/push only those files that are needed to run the program in all platforms, i.e. please do not add/commit project files auto-generated by visual studio,
for example: Program.cs and files with extensions .suo, .user etc.
